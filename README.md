This repository contains the SQL database schema and sample data for an Instagram clone, allowing you to replicate some of the basic functionality of the popular social media platform. Here we create the schemas/tables for users,photos,comments,likes,followers,hashtags.Inserted the datas for all the schemas and performed the tasks given:
1. We want to reward our users who have been around the longest. Find the 5 oldest users.
2. What day of the week do most users register on? We need to figure out when to schedule an ad campaign.
3. We want to target our inactive users with an email campaign. Find the users who have never posted a photo.
4. We are running a new contest to see who can get the most likes on a single photo. Who won ???
5. The investors want to know how many times the average user posts.
6. A brand wants to know which hashtags to use in a post. What are the top 5 most commonly used hashtags?
7. We have a small problem with bots on our siteâ€¦ Find users who have liked every single photo on the site?
